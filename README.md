# Burp Suite

## Overview
Burp Suite is a widely used penetration testing framework developed by PortSwigger for security professionals and ethical hackers. Written in Java, it acts as a proxy between the browser and the target server, enabling the interception, analysis, and modification of HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It helps identify security vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Broken Authentication** through both automated and manual testing.

## Features
- **Proxy** – Intercept and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses.
- **Intruder** – Automate brute force, fuzzing, and injection attacks.
- **Target** – Visualize and manage web application structure for testing.
- **Repeater** – Modify and resend HTTP requests to test vulnerabilities.
- **Sequencer** – Analyze session token randomness and predictability.
- **Decoder** – Encode/decode data like URL, Base64, and hashes.
- **Comparer** – Compare differences between HTTP responses or requests.
- **Logger** – Record all web traffic for debugging and tracking vulnerabilities.
- **Organizer** – Manage testing workflow, track progress, and categorize findings.

Burp Suite is an essential tool for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security researchers, providing a comprehensive suite for web application security assessments.
